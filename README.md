## Cost Estimation
---
We decided to use a t2.medium instance for the Jenkins server and a t2.medium instance for the kubernetes cluster. The cost of a t2.medium is $0.0464/hour and a kubernetes cluster is $0.10/hour. It was estimated that we would run these resources for approximately 24 hours, a day before the presentation, which was estimated at $5.
